This was solved by turning the column to string format, and replacing the incorrect groups with correct ones.\n","- There were no duplicates for the column customer_id. No significant outliers in nb_site_visits or nb_sold. However, two rows contain years_as_customer with a value higher than 40. These were marked as an error and removed, since the company was founded in 1984. All the other columns are of the correct data type, and are fully populated with correct value ranges. \n","- I have decided to impute revenue column values where missing, since the missing values exceed the 5% typical threshold for considering dropping them altogether.
