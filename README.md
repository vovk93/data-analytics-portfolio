# 📁 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio.
This repository contains projects that showcase my skills in **Python, SQL, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and analytical storytelling**. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets and deliver clear, actionable insights.

At the moment, the portfolio contains my final project from the DataCamp Data Analyst Professional Certification, with more projects to be added soon.

# 👋 About Me

I am a geospatial environmental scientist with a master’s degree, passionate about applying analytical methods to real-world problems. I am currently strengthening my skills in **Python, SQL**, and data-driven decision making, and I recently completed the **DataCamp Data Analyst Professional Certification**.

I also have experience using **QGIS** for spatial analysis and visualization, which I applied extensively during my academic work in geospatial science.

In addition to technical work, I serve as a **Special Issue Editor at MDPI**, where I coordinate scientific publications, manage peer-review workflows, and work with researchers across geospatial and environmental fields. This role has strengthened my communication, project management, and data-handling skills — all of which support my transition into data analytics.
