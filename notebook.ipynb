This was solved by turning the column to string format, and replacing the incorrect groups with correct ones.\n- There were no duplicates for the column customer_id. No significant outliers in nb_site_visits or nb_sold. However, two rows contain years_as_customer with a value higher than 40. These were marked as an error and removed, since the company was founded in 1984. All the other columns are of the correct data type, and are fully populated with correct value ranges. \n- I have decided to impute revenue column values where missing, since the missing values exceed the 5% typical threshold for considering dropping them altogether. The imputed values are drawn from the average price of a product, based on the sales method group they belong to.\n\n\n# Exploratory Analysis\n\nIn order to start analyzing the data, the first step is to group the data by the sales method/approach used to promote the new products. Below is a graph showing the total number of customers contacted in each of the three ways.\n\n![Breakdown by approach](customer_count_by_sales_method.png)\n\nWe see in the graph that the **Email method** was used the most - which makes sense, since it is the easiest of all the methods, and least time consuming.\n\n**Call method** was second most frequent way of approaching customers, meaning more people were called without a previous email, than the combined email + call method. This should be an important parameter for the sales representative, since this method consumes more time than the latter one.\n\nLastly, the **Email + Call method** is least used as an approach.\n\nThe following are tables related to the spread of the data for the entire dataset, and for each of the approaches:\n\n## Overall Revenue:\n\n| Summary Statistic | Value\n| :--- | :--- \n| Number of entries | 14998 \n| Average | 94.84\n| Standard deviation | 47.35\n| Minimum | 32.54\n| 25th percentile | 52.76\n| 50th percentile | 90.00\n| 75th percentile | 107.86\n| Maximum  |  238.32\n\nWe see that in the dataset we have a total of 14998 customers contacted in all of the three ways. The average revenue is around 95 (presumably dollars), with the maximum being 238 dollars coming from a single customer. By looking at the standard deviation, we can see that there are differences between groups of sales methods, which we can further analyze below.\n\n## Call Approach:\n\n| Summary Statistic | Value\n| :--- | :--- \n| Number of entries |  4961\n| Average | 47.57\n| Standard deviation | 8.60\n| Minimum | 32.54\n| 25th percentile | 41.46\n| 50th percentile | 48.23\n| 75th percentile | 52.7\n| Maximum  |  71.36\n\nThis group holds the second place in customers contacted, but the minimum revenue of any transaction made by customers, the lowest average revenue, and the lowest maximum revenue from any customer. Coupled with the smallest standard deviation, we can already safely assume that this method will be the least effective overall, but this will be further proven by analyses later on.\n\n## Email Approach:\n\n| Summary Statistic | Value\n| :--- | :--- \n| Number of entries | 7465\n| Average | 96.67\n| Standard deviation | 11.30\n| Minimum | 74.04\n| 25th percentile | 87.52\n| 50th percentile | 95.04\n| 75th percentile | 104.6\n| Maximum  | 148.97\n\nPeople contacted using this approach are most prevalent in the dataset. The average is close to the whole dataset average, and the standard deviation is on the lower end, especially compared to the Email and Call method, which is analyzed further down.\n\n## Email And Call Approach:\n\n| Summary Statistic | Value\n| :--- | :--- \n| Number of entries | 2572\n| Average | 180.70\n| Standard deviation | 29.49\n| Minimum | 103.87\n| 25th percentile | 155.8\n| 50th percentile | 183.7\n| 75th percentile | 191.275\n| Maximum  | 238.32\n\nThis sales method contains the highest single transaction by any customer (238 dollars), the highest average and highest minimum transaction value. It is however, the approach with the least number of customers contacted (3 times less than the top Email approach), which is an interesting piece of information. We continue with breaking down the dataset by the chosen subgroups.\n\n![Top 10 States by number of contacted customers](top10_states.png)\n\nHere we have the bar chart showing the top 10 countries by number of customers. We can see that there exists a sort of a big 4, with California being most dominant, followed by Texas, New York and Florida. The other states are much closer to each other in terms of the number of customers. \n\nBy comparing these numbers from the chart with the most populous states in the USA, we can conclude that the distribution of customers in the dataset closely resembles the distribution of population in the whole country. In other words, it is proportional to the actual population.\n\nAfter also checking the total amount of revenue by country, I have also concluded that it closely resembles the total number of customers by country, so there are no anomalies in that regard.\n\nFurther on, we will delve into deeper analysis of revenue by sales method. The following chart will give us a more understandable state of things, rather than looking at the spread of the data in the above tables.\n\n![Total revenue over time by subgroup](total_revenue_difference.png)\n\nIn terms of the total revenue achieved by the three methods (accumulated over the 6 weeks), it is obvious that the **Email approach** has brought the most money to the company from the customers - around 700,000$. We can also see that the initial first week has been the most successful for the approach, and later on the other methods have approached it in terms of results, but still by a large margin not as successful. \n\nBy week 3, we see that the **Email + Call method** kicked off, starting to build momentum and to bring in more money than the **Call method**, which is the worst one. We can also see that had the trends continued, the Email + Call method would have surpassed the Email method. \n\nWe should now take a look at the next chart, which does not accumulate sums of weeks, but rather looks at them separately, which should give us an interesting observation.\n\n![Revenue over time by week and subgroup](revenue_per_week_difference.png)\n\nThis is quite a different chart, when viewed from the perspective of divided weeks. At the beginning, we see a vast advantage of the Email method compared to the other two. By week 4, we see a type of a crossroad for the methods, where the Email + Call method surpassed the Email method! It continues until the end of the observation to be above the Email method in terms of revenue generated, but all of them combined start to see a decline in profit. The steepest drop is experienced by the Email method, the Call method never really had a more significant successful period, while the Email + Call method seems to need time in order to achieve its full potential. \n\nThis could be explained by the fact that the email and the subsequent call were separated by at least a week, so we see a very positive response from the customers, when an email is followed by a more thorough explanation by the employee, and a more detailed overview of the customer's needs. The feedback from the customer is also crucial here, since the Email method lacks the direct contact and is unresponsive to the specific situations of each of the customers.\n\nWe also need to keep in mind that the Emails were sent upon the launch of the products, and a follow-up email was sent on week #3. We can clearly see a slight incline in profit in this week, which can be explained by customers not seeing the first email for whatever reason, so at least one reminder email is important in this regard.\n\n![Revenue divided by bins and years as customer](bins.png)\n\nFinally, I would like to examine this chart - revenue divided into sales methods and bins which represent years the customer has been with us. The bars are almost perfectly proportional between bins, with the Email method being the most lucrative, followed by the Email + Call method, and lastly the Call method alone. This all follows the logic explained before, and confirms that the Email method is the one bringing in most revenue from customers. The new piece of information the sales representative should know about, is that the longer people have been our customers, the less likely they are to spend money on our new products, on average.\n\n# Definition of a metric for the business to follow\n\nIn order to create a tangible metric for the business to follow, I have used the information about how much time is spent for each of the approaches used. The Call method used up about 30 minutes of time from our employees respectively, the email + call method about 10 minutes, and the email method, for the sake of scalability, was set to about 10 seconds (even though an email merge tool could have been used, meaning almost no time was spent on this method, but the results are still compelling).\n\n| Sales method | Revenue | Number of customers | Hours spent | Revenue per hour\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---  \n| Call | 236065.80 | 4961 | 2481 | 95 \n| Email | 721705.72 | 7465 | 19  | 37,984 \n| Email + Call | 464773.97 | 2572 | 428 | 1085 \n\nAbove is a table which holds information about revenue and number of customers, just like previous tables. However, I have computed the hours spent, and divided the revenue by it, thus acquiring a metric 'Revenue per hour'.\n\nThis is a metric which shows how effective a method is in terms of work needed to be performed by our employees. \n\nAs expected, the email method is by far the most effective, even with the arbitrary time set to 10 seconds per customer. We can only assume that this metric realistically is even more dominant over the others.\n\nBy combining the information from this table with a previous chart 'Difference in revenue per week for each of the approaches', we are reminded that most of the revenue from the Email method was earned in the first half of the observation period, and the email + call method needs time to reach its full potential. Therefore, we may expect the revenue per hour to be higher for the email method in the first weeks, and lower for the email + call method. In the subsequent weeks, it is vice versa, meaning - the metric for the email will be highest upon the launch of a product, and for the email + call method - after week 3.\n\n# Final summary including recommendations that the business should undertake\n\nBased on the data drawn from 14,998 customers over a period of 6 weeks after the launch of new products, the following can be concluded:\n\n- The email contact is the dominant revenue generator for our company. It produces the highest total revenue and the highest efficiency (37,984 USD per hour). Initial customer responses to launch emails create a strong first-week spike. We should use this method aggressively following the launch of new products, with precise mail merges. The third week reminder email is recommended, since it creates a late boost in sales.\n- Email + Call becomes the most effective method after week 3. Although less scalable, it produces strong late-cycle revenue because a follow-up call personalizes the offer and increases customer engagement. This method is 11 times more effective than the call approach! Customers from this approach also tend to spend the most money compared to others.\n- The call method, because of its high time consumption, can be dropped altogether, saving a lot of working hours from our employees. We may only consider having some employees on duty, since customers may want to receive more information from us via call, but we should not be the ones contacting customers purely with this form. Bulk calling without prior email yields low revenue and poor efficiency. The time and resources from this method should be transferred to calls *after* an initial email was sent. By allocating resources from this method to the Email + Call method, which has the highest single transaction and the highest average (and the lowest number of contacted customers), we should see an even greater increase in revenue overall.\n- Focus on newer customers, who have been with us for less than 5 years. It can be assumed that these are some of the newer companies, needing more of our products to start establishing their business and offices.\n- The business should monitor the metric on a weekly basis, since each of the method's effectiveness changes over time, as previously shown.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"028600de-9ead-4753-9046-8ce0127cca3a"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.colors as colors\n\nraw_df = pd.read_csv('product_sales.csv')\n\nrevenue_nan_threshold = raw_df['revenue'].isna().sum() / 15000 * 100 #it is 7%, above \n\n#Turn 'em + call' and lowercase 'email' into correct(main) sales methods\nraw_df['sales_method'] = raw_df['sales_method'].astype(str)\nraw_df['sales_method'] = raw_df['sales_method'].replace('em + call', 'Email + Call')\nraw_df['sales_method'] = raw_df['sales_method'].replace('email', 'Email')\n\n#Remove the rows where the years_as_customer is higher than 40\nraw_df = raw_df[raw_df['years_as_customer'] < 41]\n\n\n#Now, impute the missing values in the revenue column with the mean value of the corresponding sales method, depending on the number of products sold to the customer.\n\ngrouped_df = raw_df.groupby('sales_method')['revenue', 'nb_sold'].sum()\ngrouped_df['expected_price'] = grouped_df['revenue'] / grouped_df['nb_sold']\nrevenue_dict = grouped_df['expected_price'].to_dict()\n\nraw_df['standard_price'] = raw_df['sales_method'].map(revenue_dict)\nraw_df['revenue'] = raw_df['revenue'].fillna(raw_df['standard_price'] * raw_df['nb_sold']).round(2)\nraw_df.drop(columns='standard_price', inplace=True)\n\n#Tasks: 1.
